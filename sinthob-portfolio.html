        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills in
          computer engineering and IT field.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Project 1: ParenThink Line Chat Bot</h3>
            <p>
              Developed an interactive LINE chatbot designed specifically for families to support early childhood development 
              through engaging activities focused on cognitive development and emotional regulation for young children. 
              The bot provides age-appropriate activities, games, and exercises that help children develop critical thinking skills, 
              emotional intelligence, and self-control. Features include daily activity suggestions, progress tracking for parents, 
              interactive storytelling, and guided mindfulness exercises. Built using LINE Messaging API, Node.js, and integrated 
              with child development research databases to ensure educational content is developmentally appropriate.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Project 2: Daily using ESP32 and DHT22 sensor on Telegram ( Without Clock module )</h3>
            <p>
              Created an IoT-based environmental monitoring system using ESP32 microcontroller and DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor. 
              The system automatically sends daily notifications about environmental conditions without requiring a separate clock module 
              by using "time.h" libary. Features include real-time data collection, 
              WiFi connectivity for automated alert notification on Telegram.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Project 3: Prediction chance of being Heart Attack using supervise model</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a machine learning to predict heart attack risk using supervised learning algorithms. 
              The model analyzes various health indicators including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels 
              to assess cardiovascular risk. Implemented using Python with scikit-learn, pandas for data processing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Project 4: Route Rounting in collects garbage for municipality to reduce cost as much as posible ( in Devolopment )</h3>
            <p>
              Currently developing an optimization system for municipal garbage collection routes to minimize operational costs and improve efficiency.

          <h3>Learning Programming: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <p>July 5, 2025</p>
          <p>
            As a computer engineering student, I've encountered numerous challenges while learning programming languages 
            like Python, Java, and JavaScript. One of the biggest hurdles was understanding object-oriented programming 
            concepts and how to apply them in real-world projects. Through hands-on practice and building actual applications, 
            I gradually mastered these concepts and learned to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key lesson I've learned is that consistent practice and working on diverse projects is essential for 
            improving programming skills. Each project taught me something new, whether it was debugging techniques, 
            algorithm optimization, or user interface design principles.

          <h3>Building IoT Projects: From Concept to Implementation</h3>
          <p>July 7, 2025</p>
          <p>
            Working with ESP32 microcontrollers and various sensors opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. 
            My journey started with simple LED blinking projects and evolved into complex environmental monitoring systems 
            that can send real-time data to messaging platforms like Telegram.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspect was learning to work without traditional clock modules and instead relying on 
            built-in timing libraries. This experience taught me the importance of understanding hardware limitations 
            and finding creative solutions to overcome them.

          <h3>Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Student's Perspective</h3>
          <p>July 9, 2025</p>
          <p>
            Developing a heart attack prediction model using supervised learning algorithms was both exciting and challenging. 
            The project required me to learn data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques. 
            Working with real healthcare data made me realize the potential impact of AI in improving people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience reinforced my interest in data science and artificial intelligence, and motivated me to 
            explore more applications of machine learning in solving real-world problems.
